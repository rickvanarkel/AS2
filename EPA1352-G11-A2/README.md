## Introduction

This model is build to analyze the infrastructure in Bangladesh. The aim of the model itself is to simulate trucks traveling along the infrastructure network of Bangladesh. Subsequently, the navigability of these roads can be tested. This model focuses on the N1 road. In the simulation a truck starts driving the N1 every 5 minutes with an average speed of 48 km/h. When it crosses a bridge the truck can be delayed with a certain possiblity and time that is varied by the scenarios, the bridge length and the bridge conditions. Every run simulates 5 time 24 hours. After each run an csv file is given as output containing the average time in minutes it took trucks to drive the N1.  

A description of the model files and the data files, please navigate to the READMEs attached to these (sub)models.

## How to Use

* Launch the simulation model 
```
    $ python G11_A2_run.py
```

### Format

Most README files for data or software projects are now written in Markdown format, like this document. There are some different flavours, but they are easy to write. See here for more information https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax 

Most IDEs can render Markdown files directly.
