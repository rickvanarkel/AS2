## Introduction

Every project should have a README file to help a first-time user understand what it is about and how they might be able to use it. This file is where you (as a group) shall provide the information needed by the TAs to evaluate and grade your work. 

If you are looking for information about the Demo model of Assignment 2, navigate to the [model/README.md](model/README.md) in the [model](model) directory. Have **fun** modeling in Python! 

## How to Use

Include whatever you think is necessary for someone to understand your work. The README file is usually the first file someone will see and open. It doesn't need to explain what might be obvious, but it should point out the most important things for someone looking at your work. For example, how to launch your program, what are the main files, where to find them, etc. 

### Format

Most README files for data or software projects are now written in Markdown format, like this document. There are some different flavours, but they are easy to write. See here for more information https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax 

Most IDEs can render Markdown files directly.
